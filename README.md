## Sentiment Analysis using supervised learning

Sentiment analysis is a powerful technique that allows us to extract insights from text data by determining the sentiment expressed in the text. In this project, we will build a sentiment analysis model using supervised machine learning to analyze Amazon mobile reviews. By training the model on a labeled dataset of reviews, we can classify each review as positive or  negative, enabling us to gain valuable insights into customer opinions and sentiments.
In this project, we will create a sentiment analysis model using Python and supervised machine learning techniques to analyze Amazon mobile reviews. Sentiment analysis involves training a machine learning model to recognize and classify the sentiment expressed in text as positive or negative.
